## Conclusion

This language is quite interesting, and I easily become familiar with its syntax because it's similar to PHP and TypeScript. I would prefer that language while developing software and love to work with it in some big projects. And following the tutorial was easy thanks to vscode, [rust-analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer), and [codeium](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codeium.codeium)

### Thank you [@derekbanas](https://github.com/derekbanas/) for that awesome tutorial.
